\section{Fluids}\label{sec:fluids}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Substances composed of freely moving molecules
	\item Have the ability to conform to the shape of the container that holds them
	\item There are different types of fluids in our bodies
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\frac{2}{3}$ of the body's fluid is \emph{intracellular fluid}
		\item The remaining $\frac{1}{3}$ is \emph{extracellular fluid}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_components_of_body_fluid}
	\caption{Components of Body Fluid}
	\label{fig:components_of_body_fluid}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Extracellular fluids include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \definition{Tissue fluid}{found between the cells within tissues and organs of the body}
		\item \definition{Plasma}{the fluid portion of blood that carries the blood cells}
	\end{itemize}
	\item The body fluid composition of tissue varies by
	\begin{description}
		\item[Tissue type] lean tissues have higher fluid content than fat tissues
		\item[Gender] males have more lean tissue and therefore more body fluid
		\item[Age] lean tissue is lost with age, and body fluid is lost with it
	\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\section{Electrolytes}\label{sec:electrolytes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In intracellular fluid, $\mbox{K}^{+}$ and $\mbox{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ are the predominant electrolytes
	\item In extracellular fluid, $\mbox{Na}^{+}$ and $\mbox{Cl}^{-}$ predominate
	\item There is a slight electrical charge difference on either side of the cell membrane
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions of Fluids}\label{sec:functions-of-fluids}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fluids dissolve and transport substances
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Water is an excellent \emph{solvent} because it can dissolve many different substances
		\item The dissolved materials, or \emph{solutes}, include ions, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals
	\end{itemize}
	\item Fluids account for blood volume
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \definition{Blood volume}{the amount of fluid in the blood}
		\item Increased blood volume can cause blood pressure to rise (hypertension)
		\item Decreased blood volume can cause low blood pressure
	\end{itemize}
	\item Fluids help maintain body temperature
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Because water has a high heat capacity, the temperature of our body fluids remain quite stable
		\item Sweating releases heat as the evaporation of water from the skin cools the skin and blood
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_fluids_help_maintain_body_temperature}
	\caption{Fluids Help Maintain Body Temperature}
	\label{fig:7_fluids_help_maintain_body_temperature}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fluids protect and lubricate our tissues
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cerebrospinal fluid protects the brain and spinal column
		\item Amniotic fluid protects the fetus
		\item Synovial fluid is a lubricant around joints
		\item Digestive secretions allow for easy passage
		\item Pleural fluid covering the lungs allows friction-free expansion and retraction
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions of Electrolytes}\label{sec:functions-of-electrolytes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Electrolytes help regulate fluid balance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Water follows the movement of electrolytes, moving by osmosis to areas where the concentration of electrolytes is high
		\item This allows for the controlled movement of fluids into and out of cells
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_osmosis}
	\caption{Osmosis}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_fluid_and_electrolyte_balance}
	\caption{Fluid and Electrolyte Balance}
	\label{fig:fluid_and_electrolyte_balance}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Electrolytes enable our nerves to respond to stimuli
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Movement of sodium ($\mbox{Na}^{+}$) and potassium $(\mbox{K}^{+})$ across the membranes of nerve cells changes the electrical charge across the membrane
		\item This change in electrical charge carries the nerve impulse along the nerve cell
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{7_role_of_electrolytes_in_nerve_function}
	\caption{Role of Electrolytes in Nerve Function}
	\label{fig:7_role_of_electrolytes_in_nerve_function}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Electrolytes signal our muscles to contract
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The movement of calcium ($\mbox{Ca}^{2+}$) into a muscle cell stimulates the muscle to contract
		\item The ($\mbox{Ca}^{2+}$) is pumped back out of the cell after the muscle contraction
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Maintaining Fluid Balance}\label{sec:maintaining-fluid-balance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fluid balance is maintained by different mechanisms prompting us to drink and retain fluid
	\item The \emph{thirst mechanism} occurs from a cluster of nerve cells (in the hypothalamus) that stimulate our desire to drink
	\item However, the thirst mechanism is not always sufficient; the amount of fluids people drink may not be enough to achieve fluid balance
	\item Water lost from the body must be replaced
	\item Water is lost through urine, sweat, evaporation, exhalation, and feces
	\item Water is gained through beverages, food, and metabolic reactions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Metabolic water} contributes about 10--14\% of the water the body needs
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:water_content_of_various_foods}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Loss of water
	\begin{description}
		\item[Sensible water loss] occurs through urine and sweat
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Most water is lost through urine
			\item The kidneys control how much water is reabsorbed; excess water is processed by the kidneys and excretes as urine
		\end{itemize}
		\item[Insensible water loss] occurs through evaporation from the skin or exhalation from the lungs, as well as through feces
		\item[Diuretics] increase fluid loss via the urine
	\end{description}
\end{itemize}
